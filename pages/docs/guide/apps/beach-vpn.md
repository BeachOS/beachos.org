BeachVPN is an application to provide easy and secure encrypted communication.
The app is a custom branded build of https://f-droid.org/packages/se.leap.bitmaskclient. This version is
preconfigured with one trusted provider—The Beach Institute—and allows
anonymous VPN usage without any manual setup.

By encrypting and securely routing all your network traffic through Beach's
servers, BeachVPN is able to prevent many forms of censorship and surveillance.
