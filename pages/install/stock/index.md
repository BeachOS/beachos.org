If you would like to re-install stock Android, you can follow the below steps.

## [Web Installer (Recommended, works for all Pixels)](https://flash.android.com/back-to-public)

Google provides a web installer for the Pixels, which means that you can directly install the stock OS from a web browser (even from another phone!) without having to install anything.

Going to <https://flash.android.com/back-to-public> will automatically select the latest version available from Google for your device and guide you through installation.

## Factory images (Manual installation required)

These are the latest stock factory images for your device. You can download and install them manually.

Visit <https://developers.google.com/android/images> to get links to all versions. It also has installation instructions.
